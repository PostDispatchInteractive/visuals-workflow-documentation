# Basic Mapping
### Code-free cartographic visualizations under deadline 

 
*While generally speaking, most geospatial datasets will require a broader range of technical expertise and more time than a reporter under deadline typically has, the most common and basic features of interactive and static maps can be quickly created using WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) tools.*

### Using MapHub

For purposes of creating the most rudimentary and commonly used maps under deadline (i.e. locator maps, simple point and polygon maps, etc.), a single simple, free web tool, **[MapHub](http://maphub.net)**, offers almost all the features you might need with hardly any learning curve.

*MapHub.net, a simple, free and surprisingly robust tool for geospatial mapping that works well for print and digital mediums.

Among other features, Maphub allows you to:
+ Easily make your own map by adding points, lines, polygons or labels.
+ Select from 20 different basemaps for background.
+ Import and export geospatial datasets in KML or GeoJSON (no worries if you're unfamiliar with that bit).
+ Easily hide all street names and annotate the names of the ones you want for a print graphic. 

We chose MapHub because it's neither too complex nor too lightweight for most quick mapping projeccts. It also creates maps that can be suited for print or web use.

### Getting up and running with MapHub

##### (If you prefer, I recorded [this screencast demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfUDqW8fxZo) of using MapHub as well).

1. Navigate to http://maphub.net in your browser.
2. In the top right, select "Sign Up" and sign up for a free account.
3. Although it may not prompt you immediately to do so, you'll need to check your email to verify your account before being able to publish a map.
4. Click "New Map" in MapHub once logged in. It will provide you a quick feature tour; if you wish to follow along for added context, feel free. I skipped it.
5. Notice the five buttons in the upper left? These are the five map features you can add. Each time you add a feature, it's listed an "Item" in the right panel. 
6. First, let's add a simple marker to the map. Use the built-in search in the top left to search for "900 N. Tucker Blvd." It should then take you directly to the Post-Dispatch building, although you may first have to zoom in.
7. Every "Item" has properties including: ``` color ```, ```icon```, ```title``` and ```description```. You can customize these field as you wish.
8. Second, let's go a step further
