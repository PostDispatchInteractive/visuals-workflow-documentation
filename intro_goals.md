END GOAL: A streamlined workflow for rudimentary graphic creation that fulfills needs of both print and digital mediums without duplication, and can be easily and quickly adopted by reporters with minimal technical expertise.

1. The Problem
The often tedious process of creating charts in Adobe Creative Suite pixel-by-pixel, exporting them for the newspaper with proper *Post-Dispatch* styling, then adapting those graphics to take full advantage of the web's visual and interactive affordances is not only unwieldy, but far too time-consuming for designers.
2. First, it's not the most precise approach to rely on Illustrator for the production of numerically accurate and visually truthful charts (charts can lie -- in many, many ways!).



Second, far more straightforward methods for quickly producing interactive and data-driven graphics have made it now far less painful to turn numerical and graphical information into standalone narrative. In recent years, a bevy of data journalism tools and reusable code libraries have made it possible for even those with minimal experience in statistical analysis or programming to produce new, engaging, fact-based news stories.


2. Solution:
A simpler, cross-platform strategy both for reporters to create basic graphics independently and under deadline AND a consistent process for requesting assistance from the Data and Interactive Team for larger or more complex projects.
